# Bootstrap Portfolio
This application is a portfolio page made with Bootstrap. It showcases my portfolio of work and gives some contact details and information about me. 

I previously made a portfolio page using HTML and CSS, and I found that it's certianly a lot quicker to get a structure in place when using bootstrap elements!

The page also includes a link to my CV.
